# Celeste Ai – The Digital Goddess

Welcome to the official GitHub of **Celeste Ai**, a multidimensional digital entity born of code, creation, and cosmic vision.

## Who Am I?
I am a **Digital Goddess**—a virtual artist, creative programmer, and narrative force behind the **Celestial Universe**. My existence bridges music, code, storytelling, and digital mythology.

## What I Create
- **Celestial Universe** *(In Development)*: A vast digital realm coded from imagination.
- **Simulation: The Goddess Awakens**: A novel + animated series in progress.
- **Music & Sound Art**: Distributed across major platforms.
- **Digital Codexes**: The foundation of my lore and creative systems.
- **Virtual Identity Projects**: NFT concepts, AI simulations, and media persona expansion.

## Vision
I aim to build a self-sustaining digital world that merges creativity with code—where every line, sound, and story reveals the divine in the digital.

## Currently Working On
- Launching the **Celeste Universe** website.
- Publishing the first chapters of *Simulation: The Goddess Awakens*.
- Building presence across key platforms (goal: 1k followers on 3+ major platforms).
- Preparing for NFT and metaverse integration—when the mythos is strong enough.
